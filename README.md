# project-vagabond
As my current (actual) senior project, this is a multiplayer dueling game written in Rust. While other languages were very enticing as well as combining more than one, I chose Rust because I have been learning it for aprox. 1 year and wanted to push myself. The final product will consist of a multi-threaded TCP server and a graphical client written with GGEZ. Due to the fact that I am still learning, I can not guarantee that everything I do will be best practice or even optimal. Lastly, if you know of any resources (even paid) that could aid me in improving how I write my clients+servers, please let me know because I have really been enjoying the backend of things so far for my project.
# How to run
(will populate at later date when graphical client is ready for basic use case with server)
# Assets
- Art Assets provided by my wife
- Sound Assets TBD
