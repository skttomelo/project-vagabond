# project-vagabond
As my current (actual) senior project, this is a multiplayer dueling game written in Rust. While other languages were very enticing as well as combining more than one, I chose Rust because I have been learning it for aprox. 1 year and wanted to push myself. The final product will consist of a multi-threaded TCP server and a graphical client written with GGEZ. I apologize if what I write is not the best practice or even the right way to do it as this is my first real attempt at anything involving networking. Lastly, if you know of any resources (even paid) that could aid me in improving how I write my clients+servers, please let me know because I have really been enjoying the backend of things so far for my project.
# How to run
(will populate at later date when graphical client is ready for basic use case with server)
# Assets
- Art Assets provided by my wife
- Sound Assets TBD
